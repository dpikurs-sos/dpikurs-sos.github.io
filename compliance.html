          SOS Kilkenny demonstrates strong compliance with relevant regulatory
          bodies, adhering to national standards for disability services in
          Ireland. Our residential supports operate in accordance with
          guidelines set by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).
          Regular audits and inspections are conducted to ensure continuous
          quality improvement, safety, and the delivery of person-centred care
          highlighting our dedication to accountability, ethical practices, and
          the wellbeing of the individuals we support.

          We also adhere to the regulations set by the Health and Safety
          Authority and financial regulators, including the Charities Regulatory
          Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and the Health Service Executive,
          as our main funders. This includes meeting health and safety standards
          to safeguard staff and the people we support, as well as complying
          with financial regulations to ensure transparency and accountability
          in financial management.
